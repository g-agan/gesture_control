Hardware Integration:
Utilized three ultrasonic sensors to capture precise hand movements. Each sensor was strategically placed to detect different directional gestures, providing comprehensive spatial recognition.
The sensors measured the distance between the hand and the laptop, interpreting various gestures such as swipes, taps, and holds.

Programming and Control:
Programmed the Arduino microcontroller using the Arduino IDE, employing C/C++ for efficient and responsive gesture recognition.
Implemented algorithms to process sensor data and convert it into control signals for the laptop.
Used Python in conjunction with the PyAutoGUI library to translate these signals into automated keyboard actions, allowing seamless control of the laptop interface.

Data Communication:
Established serial communication via USB port to facilitate real-time data transfer between the Arduino and the laptop.
The Arduino continuously sent sensor data to the laptop, which was then processed by the Python script to execute corresponding actions on the laptop.
